# MashedPotato takes regular expresssions that specify directories, not files:
static/js
static/css

# we have to specify subdirectories specifically
static/js/gxbo

# don't use trailing slashes, these won't match anything
# (MashedPotato will generate a warning for these)
static/js/gxbo/

# you can use any regular expression that python recognises
static/i18n/[^/]+/css
static/i18n/(au|de)/js
